This is an exercise I have undertaken to update an example marketing agency web page to improve accessibility.

I have refactored the starter code in order to make it more accessible, ensuring -  

- Semantic HTML elements are used throughout the source code
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

This has been done without impacting the appearance of the web page, which must match this mock-up -

The finished page has been deployed to GitHub Pages here -
